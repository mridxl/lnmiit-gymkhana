						The LNMIIT Students' Gymkhana isn't just a student government; it's
						the heart of campus life. Established in 2006, our mission is to
						empower students to develop their leadership skills, champion their
						peers' interests, and foster a thriving community. We're more than
						just a governing body. We're a platform for you to hone your
						leadership skills, advocate for your peers, and build lifelong
						connections. From leadership training to campus events, we offer a
						vibrant space where you can truly thrive. Our student body elects a
						Senate and Executive team, including a President and General
						Secretaries for Cultural Council, Science & Tech Council, and Games
						& Sports Council. Together, we work alongside the Institute's
						Academic Senate and Board of Governors to ensure student voices are
						heard in crucial decision-making processes. We also have nominated
						representatives in departmental committees, ensuring both
						undergraduate and postgraduate students have a say in shaping their
						educational experience. But the Gymkhana isn't just about rules and
						regulations. It's about creating an inclusive and empowering
						environment where students can thrive. We encourage you to get
						involved, share your ideas, and co-create a campus experience that's
						truly unforgettable!
